# IMO Windmill
Visualization of an [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) problem presented in 2011 as question 2.
The problem is labelled *C3* in the [list of problem proposals](https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2011SL.pdf).

The problem was introduced to me through YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown) in [The unexpectedly hard windmill question (2011 IMO, Q2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM) video. Definitely check it out.
